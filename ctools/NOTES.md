Sa may useful utilities, it also provides helper functions like ctools_include_css(), ctools_include_js(), ctools_include(), and even has a library for Math.

Chaos Tools' Tools

Provide some basic tools that we commonly use in Chaos Tools.

Plugin System

Panels - Allows you to provide context (panels context), custom content types (not to be confused with Drupal's content types), arguments, and relationships. Show how panels make use of this.

Context - Allows you create plugins for conditions and reactions. Context makes use of classes.

Form Helpers

This is actually unclear at the moment because the documentation from ctools is not yet complete. Although scannning through the source code it provides a few form tools like 'Jump Menu' which is used in Views, dependent form elements (almost similar to the States API but with less features), and Form Wizard (allows you to create multistep forms - there is an actual example of creating multi step forms from the Examples module).

AJAX Helper

Normally AJAX calls are triggered from form elements e.g. submitting a form. It can also be used for links but you will need to add include some attributes/properties but this is done automatically by Chaos Tools.

Modal

Show example later.
