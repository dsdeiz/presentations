          <h1>Chaos Tools</h1>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Module which contains a set of tools used by various contributed modules such as Views, Panels, and Context.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Chaos Tools by itself does nothing. It however provides useful utilities which can be used by your custom modules. Example helpers include AJAX, Form, Form Wizard, and Object Cache.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Chaos Tools however includes the module Page Manager which is used for managing Panel pages.</p>

          <h3>Plugin System</h3>
          <p>Chaos Tools provides a plugin system where contributed modules could make use of the system and other contributed modules (or even your custom module) could further extend the contributed module by implementing the plugins.</p>
          <p>Examples include Panels and Context</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Form Helpers</h3>
          <ul>
            <li class="fragment">Jump Menu</li>
            <li class="fragment">Dependent Form Element</li>
            <li class="fragment">Form Wizard</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>AJAX Helper</h3>
          <p>The AJAX Helper provides some additional functions which can be used to further extend Drupal's AJAX framework.</p>
          <p>An example is including a simple link or image link which triggers an AJAX call.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Modal</h3>
          <p>This is an alternative to overlay. An example where it is being used is on Panels.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Exportables</h3>
          <p>Example usage is for Context, Views, and Panels.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Form Wizard and Object Cache</h3>
          <p>Form wizard allows you to create multi-step forms with ease. This is used in combination with Object Cache. It allows you to make use of Form API and simply provide a simple configuration. This would also allow you to only create form constructors and include them in your Form Wizard configuration. This makes use of Object Cache because Object Cache provides a way to store objects as serialized data. This allows you store data that were submitted on the various steps of the form.</p>
