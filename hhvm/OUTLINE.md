# Introduction to HHVM

## What is HHVM?

HipHop Virtual Machine: Designed for executing programs written in Hack and PHP.

JIT Compilation: Compiles code on runtime. PHP is an interpreted language. With HHVM, PHP is compiled in order to increase the performance of your application.

Replacement for PHP-FPM: HHVM has support for FastCGI. Similar to PHP-FPM, HHVM can be ran as a socket or TCP address in which a web server can interact with.

Hack Language: Language similar to PHP. Not really that relevant.

## "Alternatives" to HHVM

PHP-NG: Latest HEAD in PHP. Refactored to optimize performance of PHP.

HippyVM: HippyVM is an implementation of the PHP language using RPython/PyPy technology.

Zephir: Compiles PHP code into C. Pretty much similar to PhalconPHP framework in which you load the framework as a PHP extension.
