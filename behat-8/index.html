        <h2>BDD</h2>
        <p>In software engineering, behavior-driven development (abbreviated BDD) is a software development process based on test-driven development (TDD). Behavior-driven development combines the general techniques and principles of TDD with ideas from domain-driven design and object-oriented analysis and design to provide software development and management teams with shared tools and a shared process to collaborate on software development.</p>

        <h2>Behat</h2>
        <p>It's similar to writing human-readable sentences that describe how a feature should work. What context should be given, the actions an end user should do and finally the expected output.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Writing Behat tests</h3>
        <p>Gherkin is the syntax used when producing tests. Statements are ending by using line endings. A test is usually separated into three:</p>
        <ul>
          <li class="fragment">Feature</li>
          <li class="fragment">Scenario</li>
          <li class="fragment">Steps</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h4>Feature</h4>
        <p>Features are separated into files and are named as <code>*.feature</code>. The beginning of the file starts with the keyword <code>Feature:</code>. The next three lines after defining a feature is more like a description. These next 3 lines are not usually parsed by Behat. It's usually just a description to give readers a background of the whole feature. A feature then contains different scenarios which will be further broken down into steps.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h4>Scenario</h4>
        <p>A scenario describes the actual tests. It starts with the keyword <code>Scenario:</code>. Think of it as how your application would react in a certain situation. When running Behat, you can specify which scenario it would just run. A scenario is further broken down into steps.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <p>Steps are the way you tell the test about what context it has, the actions an end user would do, and the expected outcome. Keywords used in steps are <code>Given</code>, <code>When</code>, <code>Then</code>, <code>And</code>, and <code>But</code>.</p>
        <!-- <p><strong>Given</strong> is giving your test a context e.g. <code>Given I am a logged in user with the "authenticated user" role</code>. <strong> -->

        <h3>Example:</h3>
        <pre><code class="cucumber">
@api @javascript
Feature: Calculate tax.
    As a customer,
    I need to provide valid address
    So that tax can be calculated.

    Scenario: Calculate tax.
        Given I am an anonymous user
          And I have a product with sku "FS1000" in my cart
          And I am on the commerce checkout page
        When I fill in "7732456890" for "Phone Number" in the "new_account" region
        And I fill in "bob@thejones.net" for "User ID" in the "new_account" region
        And I fill in "bob@otherjones.net" for "Contact Email" in the "new_account" region
        And I fill in "social" for "Security Question" in the "new_account" region
        And I fill in "1234" for "Security Question Answer" in the "new_account" region
        And I fill in "Test" for "First name" in the "billing" region
        And I fill in "Test" for "Last name" in the "billing" region
        And I fill in "108 5th Ave NW" for "Address 1" in the "billing" region
        And I fill in "Altoona" for "City" in the "billing" region
        And I select "IA" from "State"
        And I fill in "50009" for "ZIP Code" in the "billing" region
        And I select the ajax radio button "Manual (Cash or Check)"
        And I press the "Review Order" button
        Then I should be on the order review page
        And I should see the text "Sales tax"
